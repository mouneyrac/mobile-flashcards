This is my personal submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

## Installation

yarn install

yarn run ios

## Requirements

Only works on iOS. It may or may not work on Android, I have not tested.

## Contributing

This repository is a submission assignment for Udacity React nanodegree. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests (not like you want to do one anyway :P).
